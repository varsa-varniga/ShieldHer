              "Set up recovery options by: using a recovery email address that you check regularly, adding a phone number for verification (consider a Google Voice number for privacy), choosing security questions with answers only you would know (and that aren't easily researched), storing recovery codes in a secure location, and keeping all recovery information updated.",

            answer:
              "Credential stuffing is when attackers use leaked username/password combinations from one breach to try accessing your other accounts. Protect yourself by: using unique passwords for every site, enabling two-factor authentication, checking if your data has been breached (via haveibeenpwned.com), changing compromised passwords immediately, and using a password manager.",
